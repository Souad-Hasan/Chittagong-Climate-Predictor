 📂 Data Requirements  
File: `Chittagong Weather Data 2010-01-01 to 2022-08-22.csv`  

Required Columns:  
| Column      | Format/Description           |  
|------------|-----------------------------|  
| `datetime` | `MM/DD/YYYY`                |  
| `temp`     | Temperature in °C           |  
| `humidity` | Percentage (e.g., 75%)      |

 🔧 How It Works  
1. Data Loading: Reads historical weather data from CSV.  
2. Date Handling:  
   - Exact match → Uses recorded data.  
   - No match → Estimates using same-day averages.  
3. Output:  
   - Graphs hourly temperature fluctuations.  
   - Provides condition-based advice (e.g., umbrella alerts).
